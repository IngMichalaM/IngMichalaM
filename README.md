- 👋 Hi, my name is Michala. After moving from Switzerland (where I was working at a dental clinic in Zurich in a research team) to the Czech Republic, just before the two years of a covid pause (staying at home with the kids), I have started programming and testing online courses. And now, I am looking for a new working challenges.
- 👀 I’m interested in automated and manual testing, web automation and writting of small scripts in Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Selenium Web Driver and Manual testing and adding a little bit of Java and JavaScript+Cypress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing of small scripts in Python and manual/automation testing.
