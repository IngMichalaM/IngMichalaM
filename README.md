- 👋 Hi, my name is Michala. After moving from Switzerland (where I was working at a dental clinic in Zurich in a research team) to the Czech Republic, just before the two years of a covid pause (staying at home with the kids), I have started programming and testing online courses. And now, I am looking for new working challenges in the field of software testing.
- 👀 I’m interested in automated and manual testing, web automation and writting of small scripts in Python and JS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript (Postman).
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/ing-michala-marková
