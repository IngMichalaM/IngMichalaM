- 👋 Hi, my name is Michala. After moving from Switzerland (where I was working at a dental clinic in Zurich in a research team) to the Czech Republic, just before the two years covid pause (stying at home with the kids), I started programming and testing online courses. And I am looking for a new working challenge.
- 👀 I’m interested in automated and manual testing, web automation and writting of small scripts in Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Selenium Web Driver and Manual testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing of small scripts in Python and manual testing.
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/ing-michala-marková
